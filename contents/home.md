I am a PhD student in mathematics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. I'm interested in applied math for modeling biological and social phenomena; and motivated to use concepts in mathematical biology as a stepping stone for understanding complex social systems. I'm looking forward to developing a stronger understanding of dynamical systems and probability theory to improve modeling techniques.

Previously, I studied at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. My master's thesis at Cal Poly focused on modeling the dynamics of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) when combining continuous medication, drug resistance, and immune response. I've also been a part of many other research projects, exploring fields like graph theory and game theory, to bridge my passion for mathematics with my curiosity to extend across the academic isle.
