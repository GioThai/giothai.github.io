I am a graduate mathematics student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (I was also an undergraduate student here!) I'm interested in applied math for modeling biological and social phenomena, motivated to use what I've learned in mathematical biology as a stepping stone for understanding complex social systems.

My culminating experience at Cal Poly will be my master's thesis on modeling the dynamics of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with continuous medication, drug resistance, and immune response. But I've also been a part of many other research projects, incorporating fields like graph theory and game theory, to bridge my passion for mathematics with my curiosity to extend across the academic isle.
